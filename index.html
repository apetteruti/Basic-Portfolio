            <p id="p"> I’m a parent who spends most of her free time taking direction from a 5-year-old. You can find me 
                pretending to be Bat Girl or Wonder Woman, on the floor figuring out how to build a shark out of Legos, 
                or fitting into small spaces at the playground. In my free-time, when I have it, like to read, go for 
                walks with the family dog, and occasionally tend to our typically overgrown vegetable garden.
                </p> 
                <br>             
                <p id="p">I’m also a recovering government and non-profit employee excited to become a full-stack developer. 
                I know how to use data, research, and lots of words to get people who make decisions to make decisions. 
                I’ve created numerous dashboards and analytics, conducted research, and written many reports to help 
                keep people, especially kids, out of prison.
